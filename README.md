##  Compression Algorithms 

Brief descriptions of the files containing the compression files are as follows:

-  delta_encoding.py: Encodes data by representing the differences between consecutive elements.
  
-  huffman_coding.py: Provides compression by using variable-length codes to represent symbols.
  
-  lzma_encoding.py: Offers compression using the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm).
  
-  lzw_compressed.py: Compresses data using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm.
